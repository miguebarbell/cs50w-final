Last Project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript.

Description:
SafeApp is an app where you can generate and save logins and passwords from your online accounts or real life.

It has three main sections:

- Passwords Sections, this is the main page, where you can visualize all your stored entries.
  By default your entries are hided and just the title and date is showed, you can click them and it will display the rest of the information.
  At the bottom of every entry, there's a edit option, where you can actually edit your entry.

- Generator, here is where you can develop the news entries for your database. The fields are:
  Title: (mandatory) Whats the general name of your entry ie: gmail
  Username: weareequals@gmail.com
  Password: (mandatory) Here is the real feature of the app, you can generate a strong password for your account in a real interactive way. so the best way to manage your accounts is having this open while you acre acreating the account.
  Notes: Any special note that you want to put, ie: account valid until 1/1/2023.

- Profile, Here you can visualize your username, the passwords quantity.
  Also have the option of export the datbase to textfile so you can store locally or print it.
  And you can delete your account, after a confirmation dialog.
  These two options are next to the other, because if you want to emigrate, you do it easily here.

You use the Application by creating an user, then go and start generating entries for your record.

This project its difficult than the others, because use a own created python generator in the backend, that work in real
with the front end. making the project more reactive when the user make an input. Also the most of the site is CSS reactive.
